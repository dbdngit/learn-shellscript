git has few basic task please practise 
	- branching
	- clone
	- commit
	- push and pull 
	- pull request  ( branch to branch file merge )
	- branch policy 
	- merger, conflict
Branching: 
                                                *------*------*-------(master branch or main branch )
							\
							  --------*----*----- (feature branch)	
List of branch
	1. git branch --list
Create a new branch
	2. git branch new-feature-branch    # choose your feature branch name 
Delete existing branch 
	3. git branch -d your-existing-branch 

clone: 
	git is distrubuted repository (No server -clinet model as like svn )
	
	Local Repo    ----- >> clone /pull/push <<  ------- remote repo (azure git, github, bitbucket server )

	clone can be perform with a. ssh b. http c. gitclient  (it brings complete infromation from other system to your system) <Yes authentication required>

	git pull or git fetch perform same operation ( local --<<---<< ----- remote )
	git push (From local --->>-->>  remote )
